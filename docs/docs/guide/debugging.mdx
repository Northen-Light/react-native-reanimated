Due to Reanimated's unique architecture and usage of a second thread debugging
can be problematic and some common solutions might not work as expected.
This article summarizes all the available methods and highlights their caveats.

Reanimated v1 works with all of the common React Native debugging tools. This
article focuses on the use of these tools with Reaniamted v2.

### React Native debugging tools

These are the debugging tools we checked for compatibility with React Native
apps using the Reanimated library:

- [**Chrome debugger**](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#chrome-developer-tools)
(also known as _React Native Debugger_) is a simple tool that creates a web
worker inside your preferred browser which executes your app's code.

- **Chrome DevTools**
are Chrome's built-in feature that allow connecting to a remote JavaScript runtime.
This means that the code you are debugging actually runs on the device itself and
behaves the same way as it would with DevTools detached.

- [**Flipper**](https://fbflipper.com/) (Hermes debugger) is an app created by
Facebook that makes it easy to use _Chrome DevTools_ and provide additional tools for
UI inspection and debugging.

- [**Safari DevTools**](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#safari-developer-tools)
are Safari's built-in feature and are available for iOS devices only. They work
very similarly to Chrome DevTools - they allow you to connect to a remote runtime
and keep code execution on device.

- [**React DevTools**](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#react-developer-tools)
are a tool that allows debugging UI through the inspector as well as monitoring
performance and profiling your app.
