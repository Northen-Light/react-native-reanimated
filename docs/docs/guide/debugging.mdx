Due to Reanimated's unique architecture and usage of a second thread debugging
can be problematic and some common solutions might not work as expected.
This article summarizes all the available methods and highlights their caveats.

:::info

Reanimated v1 works with all of the common React Native debugging tools. This
article focuses on the use of these tools with Reaniamted v2.

:::

### React Native debugging tools

These are the debugging tools we checked for compatibility with React Native
apps using the Reanimated library:

- [**Chrome debugger**](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#chrome-developer-tools)
(also known as _React Native Debugger_) is a simple tool that creates a web
worker inside your preferred browser which executes your app's JavaScript code. It works
with all the runtimes available in React Native.

- [**Chrome DevTools**](https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes#debugging-js-on-hermes-using-google-chromes-devtools)
(unavailable for JSC) is Chrome's built-in feature that allows for connecting to a
remote JavaScript runtime. This means that the code you are debugging actually
runs on the device itself and behaves the same way as it would with DevTools detached.

- [**Flipper**](https://fbflipper.com/) (Hermes debugger) is an app created by
Facebook that makes it easy to use _Chrome DevTools_ while providing additional tools for
UI inspection and debugging.

- [**Safari DevTools**](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#safari-developer-tools)
is Safari's built-in feature and are available for iOS devices running JSC only. It works
very similarly to Chrome DevTools - it allows you to connect to a remote runtime
and keep code execution on device.

- [**React Developer Tools**](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging#react-developer-tools)
are a tool that allows debugging UI through the inspector as well as monitoring
performance and profiling your app.

### Debugging web apps

For debugging web apps you may use the tools you prefer or any that are provided
by the browser of you choice. We did not discover any issues with debugging
apps using Reanimated on web.

### Summary

<SummaryTable />

### Chrome Debugger

<ChromeDebuggerTable />

:::info

Works, but uses web implementations of functions and runs everything on the JS thread.

:::

Since the Chrome Debugger runs it's own web worker all the code is run on
the JS thread so it also uses the JavaScript engine provided by your web
browser (V8 in Chrome, JSC in Safari and SpiderMonkey in Firefox). This
means that this piece of code:

```js
function runWorklet() {
  'worklet';
  console.log('worklet:', _WORKLET);
}
runOnUI(runWorklet)();
```

would output:

```
LOG: worklet: false
```

Another side effect is that Reanimated uses the web implementations of all
function. This means that the `scrollTo` function will work
(using the native web implementation), but the `measure`
function will not be available and it's usage will trigger this error:

```
[reanimated.measure] method cannot be used for web or Chrome Debugger
```

You may stil use the standard web version of measure as described
[here]('https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/api/nativeMethods/measure').

Those functions that are provided by Reanimated and do not have web
implementations won't work.

An example of this behaviour is the `useAnimatedSensor` hook
which only works on mobile platforms. When debugging in Chrome and using
this hook the following message will appear in the logs:

```
[Reanimated] useAnimatedSensor is not available on web yet.
```

But despite all of this, it is still possible to set breakpoints both in
normal JS code as well as in worklets (since they run on the main JS
thread now).

### Chrome DevTools

<ChromeDevToolsTable />

:::info

Works, but only the JS context can be debugged.

:::

Even though Chrome DevTools supports the Hermes and V8 engines it
unfortunatley doesn't recognize Reanimated's additional UI context. This
means that you won't be able to debug worklets and breakpoints set in them
will be ignored. All other features work as expected.

*We are actively working on enabling worklet debugging with Chrome DevTools on Hermes.*

### Flipper (Hermes debugger)

<FlipperTable />

:::info

Works, but only the JS context can be debugged.

:::

Even though Flipper supports the Hermes and V8 engines it
unfortunatley doesn't recognize Reanimated's additional UI context. This
means that you won't be able to debug worklets and breakpoints set in them
will be ignored. All other features work as expected.

*We are actively working on enabling worklet debugging with Flipper on Hermes.*

### Safari DevTools

<SafariDevToolsTable />

:::info

Safari DevTools is only available on iOS devices running the JSC engine.

:::

After opening Safari and configuring it as specified in the React Native
docs, under `Develop > Device` you'll see two JSC contexts
like in the screenshot below:
<img
  src="/react-native-reanimated/img/debugging/SafariJSCiOS.png"
  alt="Screenshot showing Safari's Develop menu options"
/>
One of them will be the main JS context. All `console.log`
outputs will appear in the console of this context. You can also set
breakpoints here, but unfortunatley the only source file visible is the
transformed `indexjs.bundle` which does make things more
difficult to find.

The other option will be the UI context. No console logs will appear in
the console of this context, but all worklet functions should be visible
as separate files. It is also possible to set breakpoints in these
worklets.

**Caution!**
*Remember that console logs will appear on the main thread as the
`console.log` funcion on the UI thread is just a reference to the one from
the JS thread.*

### React Developer Tools

:::info

React Developer Tools work as expected and the profiler and layout inspector can
be used as usual.

On Android remember to first run the command:
```
adb reverse tcp:8097 tcp:8097
```
